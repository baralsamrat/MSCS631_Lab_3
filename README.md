# Experience and Challenges:

In completing this SMTP client assignment, I gained a deeper insight into the SMTP protocol,
particularly the necessity of securing connections with STARTTLS and authenticating using AUTH LOGIN.
Handling the base64 encoding of credentials and correctly formatting each command (with CRLF sequences)
were critical to successfully communicating with Gmailâ€™s SMTP server.

One of the main challenges was adapting the simple socket-based client to work with a server that requires
secure connections and authentication. Learning to use Python's ssl module and properly manage the SMTP
authentication handshake provided invaluable hands-on experience in network security and protocol debugging.
